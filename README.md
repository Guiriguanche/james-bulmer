# Fast Food Map

The goal of this repo will be to hopefully produce a map that shows the correlation (if any) between the number of fast food outlets and BMI in America, this will be a quick and dirty project just to visualize the data available. Feel free to jump in and make any suggestions and/or comments to improve its function and usefulness to the rest of the group
